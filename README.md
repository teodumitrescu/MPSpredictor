<h1> Tree Generation for optimal binarization evaluation </h1>

<h3> Predictor developed by a team of 5 Computer Science students:  </h3>
<ul>
<li>Mihai Blacioti (342C5) -- Tester  </li>
<li>Maria - Cristina Brinza (342C5) -- Software Developer  </li>
<li>Stefana - Ioana Dranca (341C1) -- Team Leader  </li>
<li>Ioana - Teodora Dumitrescu (342C5) -- Project Manager  </li>
<li>Cosmin - Viorel Lovin (342C1) -- Software Developer  </li>
</ul>

<h3> Overview </h3>
The project is built on the notion of binarization and consists of two solutions. The two approaches are based on the principles of global and local binarization and the corresponding binarization algorithms. The study objective is to cleverly merge the results of these algorithms (also referred toÂ as thresholds or binarization thresholds) to generate a result that is considerably superior to each one of them alone.
